# develojopa is the place, where my first steps to IT took place

In the context of the profile as a whole, the "develojoping-ment" can be seen as a rough draft, for now, even if it may not follow the best approach completely. But this is not a big issue as long as the end result is not greatly affected. This initial section is dedicated to comprehending not only the programs and the code itself, but also, in principle, the underlying platforms and mechanisms of operation. After all, this is the first project, I was just learning and figuring things out. to repeat at my own risk, although mine are few if not none - after this short introduction, I attach all the materials that I have relied on and used. To be honest, there is more info than even needs for beginning, just be patient and attentive, and especially to these particularly helpful sources (libs and step-by-step tutorials).

# Telegram Bot with Birthday and Personal Messages

## Introduction

This project is a Telegram bot written in Python. 
The resources used in the development are standard - BOT API, python-telegram-bot.
The initial idea was to realize the possibility of quick and convenient communication with me directly through the site, which would make it easier for a potential customer to make a purchase/receive information/receive answers to questions, etc., which in general would have a positive impact on the communication device as a whole (which can and does have a positive impact on the commercial side of the project (if it is commercial). For me, as an implementer, it would also simplify communication with the client due to the possibility of communicating in the most comfortable and accessible way.

However, during the development process, ideas and the opportunity to implement a number of other features came up, some of which are listed below and have already been implemented, in the debugging and soon-to-be-launched or under development phase.

## Functionality:

1. Contact with a potential client, meet and greet, bot description and instructions for use.
2. Providing basic information, frequently asked questions (assorted) and answers.
3. Contact information and contacts for complaints/suggestions/cooperation.
4. Range of services and price list.
5. Documentation and licenses
